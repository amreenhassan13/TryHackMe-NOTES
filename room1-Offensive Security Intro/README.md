This room introduces the basics of offensive security by using **Gobuster** to discover hidden web pages on a fake banking website.

---

Use Gobuster to brute-force the FakeBank website (`http://fakebank.thm`) and discover hidden directories or admin panels.

---

## ðŸ›  Tool Used: Gobuster

Gobuster is a command-line tool used to brute-force:

* DNS subdomains
* Virtual hosts

In this room, we use Gobuster in **directory scanning** mode.

```bash
gobuster -u http://fakebank.thm -w wordlist.txt dir
```
## ðŸªœ Steps Followed

- Opened a terminal (command-line interface).
